# Argo CD Interview Questions and Answers

---

## 1. What is Argo CD and how does it work?

**Answer:**  
Argo CD is a tool that helps you automatically deploy your apps to Kubernetes by watching the code in Git. When you change something in Git, Argo CD notices and updates your Kubernetes cluster to match that change.

---

## 2. Explain the GitOps methodology and how Argo CD implements it.

**Answer:**  
GitOps means using Git as the single place where you keep your app’s configuration. You make all changes by updating Git, and tools like Argo CD make sure your Kubernetes cluster matches what’s in Git automatically.

---

## 3. How do you perform application deployment and rollback in Argo CD?

**Answer:**  
You deploy by syncing your app from Git to Kubernetes using Argo CD. If something goes wrong, you can rollback to a previous version easily using Argo CD’s interface or commands.

## 4. What are the main components of Argo CD?

**Answer:**  
Argo CD has these key parts:  
- **API Server**: talks to users and other tools  
- **Controller**: watches Git and syncs apps  
- **Repository Server**: talks to Git repositories  
- **UI**: a web dashboard to see and control your apps

## 5. How does Argo CD handle sync failures or conflicts?

**Answer:**  
If Argo CD can’t sync because of errors or conflicts, it shows an error in the dashboard. You can then fix the problem (like fixing YAML files) and try syncing again.

---

## 6. Can you explain the difference between manual and automatic synchronization in Argo CD?

**Answer:**  
- **Manual sync**: You decide when to update the cluster by clicking “sync”.  
- **Automatic sync**: Argo CD updates the cluster automatically whenever Git changes.

## 7. What are ApplicationSets in Argo CD?

**Answer:**  
ApplicationSets let you create and manage many Argo CD applications automatically, especially useful when you want to deploy the same app to multiple clusters or environments.

---

## 8. How do you secure Argo CD and manage access control?

**Answer:**  
You secure Argo CD by using authentication (like usernames/passwords or OAuth), and by setting roles and permissions so only authorized users can change or view apps.

---

## 9. How do you integrate Argo CD with other CI/CD tools?

**Answer:**  
You use CI tools (like Jenkins or GitHub Actions) to build and push your code or images. Then Argo CD watches Git for changes and deploys them to Kubernetes automatically.

---

## 10. How does Argo CD manage multi-cluster deployments?

**Answer:**  
Argo CD can connect to many Kubernetes clusters and deploy apps to all of them from a single place, making it easier to manage multiple environments.
